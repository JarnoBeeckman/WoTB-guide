   <h1>WoTB training - Super Unicum Guide</h1>
   <h2>Introduction</h2> <br>
    </header>
    <p>Before you read everything and start the guide, I'd like you to know that I'm not even close to being the best player (but I am super unicum).<br> 
    However, I do believe that I'm good enough to make a guide and teach people how to become better, maybe even better than myself since I don't master every step myself. <br><br>
    The guide consists of about 10 steps and most of them are quite large. Each step can take days, weeks or even months to be completed,<br>
     to master them even longer depending on your ability to learn. Also the purpose of this guide is to improve you as a player, not as a team player for tournaments.
     <br> <div>!By completing a step, I mean executing them in-battle without even thinking about it. <br>
     Everything should go automaticly while playing, if that's not the case, you should not move on to the next step</div> to avoid overthinking trying to do multiple steps. <br><br>
     Disclaimer: You will not be able to master a step (at least not most of them) in just 1 days. The amount of time depends on how much you play, how much experience you had already and your ability to learn. <br>
     Getting better at WoTB will take time and patience, perhaps practise in training rooms. <br>
     Exactly HOW good you will be after completing the guide, is fully dependant on your own time-spending in-game, experience, logical and strategic thinking. <br>
<br> Just a hint to people that feel like they play badly and perform badly: please don't play or practise in Rating battles, it ruins the purpose of the mode.
<br><br> Another disclaimer: playing modes with modifications like Mad Games, Uprising, Gravity, ... do not give good practise. <br><br><br></p>
